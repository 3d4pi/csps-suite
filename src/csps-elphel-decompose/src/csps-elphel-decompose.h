     *
     *  The csps-suite is dedicated to CSPS processing using libcsps. It provides
     *  a serie of softwares used for camera logs-files preparation and 
     *  validation according to manufacturers standards. It comes with a main 
     *  software that is responsible of CSPS processing, using libcsps, of the
     *  camera logs-files and also offers softwares for CSPS processing results
     *  visualization and exportation
     *
     *  \section Documentation
     *
     *  A detailed documentation can be generated through doxygen. A more general
     *  documentation can be consulted at https://github.com/FoxelSA/csps-suite/wiki.
